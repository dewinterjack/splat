# Splat

*Create a music playlist based on multiple people's tastes*

This application is being worked on in multiple sections, an Ionic Application, working on iOS, Android, Web (and more), a web based OAuth2 system using the Spotify API and eventually a Splat API for retrieving Splat data.

The OAuth2 project is a simple interface to learn more about how the protocol comes into practise. 

Run:

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
