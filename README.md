# Splat

*Create a music playlist based on multiple people's tastes*

This application is being worked on in multiple sections, an Ionic Application, working on iOS, Android, Web (and more), a web based OAuth2 system using the Spotify API and eventually a Splat API for retrieving Splat data.

The OAuth2 project is a simple interface to learn more about how the protocol comes into practise. 

In order to run the project, the node module, [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) must be installed (gloabally would make sense).

```bash
npm i http-server -g
```

Then running the server with the -o flag (inside the cloned project directory) will open the browser when the server is ready.

```bash
http-server -o
```
